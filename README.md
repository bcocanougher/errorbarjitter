# errorbarjitter

The purpose of this script is to provide modular code for generating errorbarjitter plots using python and pandas. The framework for this code was written in collaboration with Jason Wittenbach ([@jwittenbach](http://github.com/jwittenbach)) of Janelia Research Campus. The idea is based on the [matlab errorbarjitter](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33658-errorbarjitter) code writtten by David Stern, also of Janelia Research Campus. This version uses free and open source software to achieve the same plot.
