# errorbarjitter

The purpose of this script is to provide modular code for generating errorbarjitter plots using python and pandas. The errorbarjitter function was written in collaboration with Jason Wittenbach ([@jwittenbach](http://github.com/jwittenbach)) of Janelia Research Campus. The idea is based on the [matlab errorbarjitter](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33658-errorbarjitter) code writtten by David Stern, also of Janelia Research Campus. This version uses free and open source software to achieve the same plot.

As in the original errorbarjitter, this function plots the mean (closed circle) ± SD (bar) with raw data; the raw data are jittered and an alpha value is used to transparency to aid in separation of individual data points. This form of data presentation invites active analysis of the raw data by the reader.
